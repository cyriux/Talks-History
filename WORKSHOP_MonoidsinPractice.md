# WORKSHOP Monoids in Practice

Monoids are easy to learn, and really useful to model many real-life business situations. Monoids are simple maths creatures, that you're familiar with without knowing it. In fact, the only difficult thing with monoids is their name. Still, how do you actually start using them in code?

Join Cyrille for this little workshop where you will be guided towards coding your own domain model powered by monoids, so that you can apply them at work the next day.

## Expected Audience:

This workshop is for developers in any programming language, Java and equivalent being the sweet spot. You’ll code in your IDE (or with the IDE of your coding partner). A quick grasp of monoids would be ideal, but not necessary.

## Key learning points:

- Revisit your understandings of (or discover) monoids
- Put monoids into practice through the Monoid Kata (or another even more difficult kata of your choice if you’re adventurous)
- Acknowledge the limits of the approach, and the relationships with other design patterns
