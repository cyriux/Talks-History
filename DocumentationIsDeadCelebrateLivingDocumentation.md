# Documentation is Dead, Celebrate Living Documentation!


*The benefits of documentation without the frustration*

## Abstract
Unhappy about documentation? Prefer coding over writing? Discover the
Living Documentation approach in practice through concrete examples!

Since the Agile manifesto, we value working software over
comprehensive documentation, and that is a good thing. However this
does not mean that documentation is unnecessary.

Indeed, with practices like TDD, BDD, Domain-Driven Design and guided
by some principles you can have reliable and efficient documentation
without spending time on it. This "Living Documentation" is just
embedded within the usual development practices, and it gained the
ability to remain closely in sync with the software. In addition, the
idea of working software as a form of documentation can be applied
literally, at compile-time and at runtime.

Through several examples, this talk will explore this silent
revolution, and how to benefit from it in your projects.
