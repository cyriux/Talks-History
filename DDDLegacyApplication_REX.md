# DDD in a legacy application (Experience Report)

## Abstract

A software editor in finance was facing the challenge to extend substantially the capabilities of its main application, despite 20 years of legacy in multiple technologies. In this talk we'll report on how DDD has been applied to capture deep models of the domain, within bounded contexts that emerged in the course of the project, and how DDD also helped to build a strategy for dealing with the legacy code.
