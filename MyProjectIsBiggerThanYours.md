# My project is bigger than yours - is size of code a measure of waste? 

## Abstract 
Size, from the number of lines of code to the number of people in a project, is one of the most obvious metric, but what does it really tell us? 

Is the size of code a measure of functional scope and complexity, or could it be a measure of waste? 

Does the size of the team measure the capacity to deliver more value, or a measure of waste and vanity? 

We'll go through an experiment with code to show how the same feature can be implemented with very little code or with a lot of code. We'll also discuss the effect of the size of the teams.

This topic is related to development practices like TDD and Domain-Driven Design, and some typical FP goodness.
