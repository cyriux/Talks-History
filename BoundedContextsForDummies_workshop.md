# Bounded Context for dummies

You keep on hearing about Bounded Context but still not sure what they are and what they are for? Want to do microservices the right way? 

Join me for a mini training session totally dedicated to Bounded Contexts! Through little games you'll understand the beast, you'll be able to spot them in the wild and you'll even be able to recognize the ugly ones!
