#  Domain-Driven Dependencies 

Dependencies come in many forms, from binary libraries to JSON contracts for example. While they are necessary to build complex systems, dependencies are also the cause of a lot of headaches, and learning how to better deal with them makes your life less miserable in the long run.

Though this talk you'll explore the universe of dependencies in the light of Domain-Driven Design. From the good old Hexagonal Architecture and its variants, the dependencies between Tactical Patterns at small scale to Cohesive Mechanisms or the Levels of Responsibility at a larger scale, you'll discover guiding principles that you can use to improve your design taste for great good.
