# Modelling Music for DDD practitioners

Most introductory material on music focuses on melody, rhythm and harmony, in the tradition of written classical music. Yet, there's much more than that in music! Playing and creating instruments, sound synthesis, psycho-acoustic perception and illusions, how all this is shaping musical genres, interactions of musicians or DJ with the audience, MIDI production techniques... these all sound like Bounded Contexts to the DDD practitioner. 
Through this session we'll model parts of the rich domain of music with Java and Arduino, in what's really an application of DDD. With some home-made cheesy video, you'll discover and understand music in a new light, and you'll feel like doing your own experiments back at home! 


## Additional Information & outline
This talk builds on my past experience building personal research projects I've done around music in Java and Arduino in the past years:

- Creating a *playable* instrument: balancing spontaneity and expressiveness vs difficulty to play in rhythm and in tune (a DIY Light Air Guitar playing a quantized pentatonic scale with a Smart Pitch Bending)
- Literally modelling the internal hardware machine representation (the iconic Hip-Hop Akai MPC) in desktop software (my popular MPC Maid editor for the Akai MPC 500-1000-2000)
- Putting the Groove into equations (Swing %), and how it defined music genres (when introduced in TR808 and Akai MPC), with a concrete Arduino application to groove any MIDI clock, e.g. an Arpeggiator
- Rhythmic Onsets detection & MIDI Sequencing (the auto-slicing tool built-in MPC Maid, showing very simply how it enables basic time-stretching)
- Automatic classification of sound samples by FFT &  Features Extraction with Support Vector Machine (failed experiment but still interesting) 
- Exploring Aesthetics of music: The Wundt Curve and self-similarity of musical patterns, e.g. Fugue, or Rhythmic Layering (a simple Generative Sequencer built with Arduino)
- Shyness and social inhibition, and how anonymity changes everything (we used to make some social experiments of Jam Sessions at home with very shy  non-musicians colleagues, showing how sound effects that make your voice unrecognisable help, plus my past DJ experience dealing with small or large crowds)

I'll show code along with audio and video recordings, e.g. (audio and video recordings)[https://vimeo.com/user1310376] to illustrate the content. The challenge is to keep the talk short and affordable for full beginners, while still showing enough in-depth DDD for the DDD Police :)
