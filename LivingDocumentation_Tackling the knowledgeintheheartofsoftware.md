# Living Documentation: Tackling the knowledge in the heart of software

If you prefer coding over writing documentation, then youâ€™ll love Living Documentation! A Living Documentation is a new approach to dramatically improve how knowledge is shared in the development team, with a minimal extra cost by using judiciously-crafted artifacts and some automation to evolve at the same pace as the ever-changing codebase. It builds on top of practices like BDD and DDD, but it also has its own key principles and novels ways to documenting every aspect of making software, from defining the business goals to discovering the domain knowledge, creating the architecture, designing and coding.

Join Cyrille Martraire, the author of the book "Living Documentation" (Addison-Wesley Professional, 2019) to find out how to speed up your software delivery by implementing this approach in your projects!
