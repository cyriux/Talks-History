# DDD patterns that were not in the book

## Abstract
    
We often relate Domain-Driven Design with the content of Eric Evans' book; however even this book suggests looking outside for other patterns and inspirations: analysis patterns (Accounting, Finance), domain-oriented use of design patterns (the Flyweight pattern), established formalisms (e.g. monoids) and XP literature in particular (e.g. the patterns on the c2 wiki and OOPSLA papers).

The world has not stopped since the book either, and new ideas keep on emerging regularly. And you can share your own patterns as well.

In this session, through examples and code we'll go through some particularly important patterns which deserve to be in your tool belt. We'll also provide guidance on how best to use them (or not), at the right time and in the right context, and on how to train your colleagues on them!
