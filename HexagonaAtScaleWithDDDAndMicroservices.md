# Hexagonal at Scale, with DDD and microservices!

Microservices need DDD absolutely. Bounded Contexts, a key DDD ingredient, are the tool of choice to define services boundaries that won’t end up in a complete disaster at runtime and at deploy time. And for a given service, the Hexagonal Architecture is a great implementation style. 

In this talk you’ll get a deeper understanding of what these abstract buzzwords are all about, illustrated with short Java code. You’ll discover how to really split your monolith correctly, and when to go Hexagonal, or not, because one should never abuse of the good things. And it will be fun, with a few other surprises as well.


## Outline 

- Partitioning services by domains, as Bounded Contexts (code)
- Local Hexagonal (code)
- Groups of services behind an API Gateway, and with proxy services for providers : a global Hexagonal-ish architecture too!
- (Legacy)
