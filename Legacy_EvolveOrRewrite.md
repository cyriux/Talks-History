# Legacy Code: Evolve or Rewrite?

## Abstract

You have to deliver ambitious new features but your codebase is a huge mess of legacy technologies, with no test?

It is very tempting to throw it all away and rewrite everything from scratch, but is it wise when you consider the associated cost, risk and delayed time-to-market?

Through an experience report, we'll show a "Strangler Application" strategy where only carefully selected areas of legacy code are rewritten. Agile development techniques like BDD or TDD remain necessary, with some adjustments.

We'll also describe step by step the overall thinking process you can use  to deal with large legacy code bases efficiently.
