# DDD beyond the infamous repository pattern

## Abstract

DDD is often misinterpreted in so many ways. Many teams focus only on the tactical patterns, or even consider repositories as mere glorified DAO's and forget about all the other concepts that really matter: the focus on the business domain, modeling in code, and the concept of Bounded Contexts.

In this talk for junior and senior developers alike, we'll clarify the few most important building blocks of DDD. We will also illustrate how practicing DDD actually looks like. This talk is the perfect opportunity to get started on DDD on solid grounds!

## Description

This is an introduction for any audience of what DDD is really like and what it's not. No jargon, easy examples, it's a popular talk.
