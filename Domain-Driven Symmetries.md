# Domain-Driven Symmetries

## Abstract
    
Symmetries are everywhere, but without practice we often miss many of them. This is a pity: symmetries, and their close friends called "Invariants", are very useful guidance for modeling business domains, both for design purposes and for exploring and challenging our understanding of the domain as early as possible.

In this talk we'll explore symmetries in various business domains, and even between seemingly unrelated domains. We'll share hints to help spot these symmetries and invariants until it becomes second nature. And once you see them everywhere, we'll reflect on how to chose the most important ones for your models, in relation with Bounded Contexts.
