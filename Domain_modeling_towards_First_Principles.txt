# Domain modeling towards First Principles 

As developers we are often explained the business domain in a way that is corrupted by implementation concerns or past constraints. This is harmful. To achieve better domain models, we often have to reverse-engineer. Alternatively, we can also explore the domain from its first principles, which are the main concepts or assumptions that cannot be deduced from anything else.

Reaching for first principles takes more mental energy, but is also the key to more radical innovations beyond small incremental evolutions. It also turns domain modeling into a fun puzzle to solve.

Through examples you will discover how domains can be deconstructed towards their essential first principles, in order to reconstruct sharp domain models.
