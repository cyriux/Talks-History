Hey! I'm [@cyriux on Twitter](https://twitter.com/cyriux) and on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martraire)

I wrote a book **Living Documentation**, published by [Pearson/Addison-Wesley Professionals](http://www.informit.com/livingdoc) after a first life on Leanpub. I'm helping development teams get better at software design and Domain-Driven Design in particular through talks, workshops and teaching training courses everywhere.

Since I've launched the Paris Software Crafters (formerly known as Craftsmanship) Community in 2011 I've been speaking in many conferences a bit everywhere. My talks usually revolve around DDD, Design & Software Craft practices in general. My focus is on exploring our design & collaborative practices to improve our job of working with software in the long term. Related to that, an important goal in my talks and my book is to make design skills more popular for a mainstream audience, while being fun and entertaining.
