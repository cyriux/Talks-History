I'm [@cyriux on Twitter](https://twitter.com/cyriux) and on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martraire)

I wrote a book **Living Documentation**, published by [Pearson/Addison-Wesley Professionals](http://www.informit.com/livingdoc) after a first life on Leanpub. 

Most days I'm helping development teams and their business friends get better at software design and Domain-Driven Design in particular through talks, workshops and teaching training courses in France and beyond.

Since I've launched the Paris Software Crafters (formerly known as Craftsmanship) Community in 2011 I've been speaking in many conferences a bit everywhere. My talks usually revolve around DDD, Design & Software Craft practices in general. My focus is on exploring our design & collaborative practices to improve our job of working with software in the long term. Related to that, an important goal in my talks and my book is to make design skills more popular for a mainstream audience, while being fun and entertaining.

# Consulting

I do a lot of short to medium-term consulting for companies of all types and sizes, mostly in France and in various domains like trading, financial services, distribution, agriculture, accounting etc. My practice draws on a deep practice of software developments over two decades, using Domain-Driven Design and with a focus on software as a large-scale, complex (and not just complicated), hybrid (technology & humans), adaptive system.

This activity that was historically done at [Arolla](https://www.arolla.fr) is now officially part of [Le Singe Cuivre](https://www.lesingecuivre.com/), our subsidiary which specializes in helping clients achieve the transformation they are looking for.

## Examples of consulting work

- Identification of the boundaries for **splitting a monolith** into smaller services in a microservices architecture, or modules within a modular monolith, typically in the context of moving to a PaaS
- Identification of  the boundaries for splitting components and the related teams to **scale the software delivery with less coordination cost**
- Identification of the contexts and opportunities for **renovating a large legacy in a progressive and cost-effectice way**, without pretending it can be planed precisely upfront
- **Modeling the challenging parts of a business domain**, using all the techniques from Domain-Driven Design and from many years of experience across many sectors 
- **Constructive assessment** of a software organizations, for due diligence, to improve a situation, to tackle a risk or understand a failure 
- Interviews and workshops to **converge on a good consensus between a group of stakeholders**, to unleash strong commitment to action

## How I do that in practice

- Interviews & collaborative workshops using tools like Context Mapping, Event-Storming, Impact Mapping, Wardley mapping etc.
- Reviews of business & technical documents, code reviews, walkthroughs of technical systems
- Sometime pair or mob-programming with a few developers to study a particular aspect
- Frequent presentations of the findings so far, to get immediate feedbacks and never surprise the people involved
- Formal presentations to development teams, product people, management and senior management
- Internal training on the whole chain of software delivery
