# Breaking conventions for more performant models

Everything’s possible when you model a domain, and you don’t have to follow conventions. Indeed, it can be beneficial to model time, space, roles and anomalies in unconventional ways to simplify the model and enhance its performances. 

In this talk, we will present multiple examples demonstrating how taking liberties with domain traditions can be advantageous within bounded contexts and sometimes even in identifying the bounded contexts themselves. 

# Notes

This is a call to action to encourage software practioners to model beyond the obvious. 

The end of day doesn't have to be at midnight, regions don't have to be administrative. Time and space can also be split in irregular ways. And domain anomalies don't necessarily have to be seen as actual failures.
